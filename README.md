# Digital-Receipt-Archiving-System-with-QR-Support-
A smart POS system that prevents receipt loss by generating QR codes linking to digital receipts â€“ helping businesses track expenses and reduce taxes.

Digital-Receipt-Archiving-System-with-QR-Support is a Point-of-Sale (POS) solution designed to solve a common but costly problem faced by small and medium business owners: **lost receipts and untracked expenses**. By generating QR-coded digital receipts that can be accessed via the internet, this system ensures every expense is securely stored and easily retrievable â€“ a crucial step in **maximizing deductible business expenses and minimizing tax liability**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose

In traditional workflows, business owners often need to **manually submit paper receipts to their accountants** to record and claim their business expenses. However, these receipts are frequently lost, damaged, or forgotten â€“ resulting in missed tax deductions and higher tax payments.

Digital-Receipt-Archiving-System-with-QR-Support solves this problem by:
- Generating **QR codes** on receipts
- Linking each QR to a **hosted digital version** of the receipt
- Enabling remote, **internet-based access to receipts**
- Providing a centralized system where expenses are always tracked and reportable

## ðŸ§  Core Features

- **QR Code Generation for Receipts:**
  - Each receipt includes a QR code linking to a digital version stored online
  - Ensures long-term accessibility and prevents physical loss

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - Simple and clean UI for both employees and business owners

- **Remote Access to Receipts:**
  - QR leads to a hosted web page (or PDF) containing receipt details
  - Works from any device with a browser and internet access

- **Printable & Shareable Invoices:**
  - Invoices are generated dynamically and can be printed, downloaded, or shared

- **Expense Reporting & Filtering:**
  - View reports by date range, amount, category, or employee
  - Helps businesses analyze spending and prepare documentation for tax reports

- **Secure Receipt Storage:**
  - Prevents unauthorized access while ensuring quick retrieval

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- **C# / .NET** â€“ Backend logic and interface
- **MSSQL** â€“ Database for storing receipts and transactions
- **QR Code Library** â€“ For generating dynamic QR codes
- **PDF & HTML generation** â€“ For printable/exportable receipts
- **WinForms/WPF** â€“ Desktop GUI

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. A customer makes a purchase.
2. The system generates a **receipt with a unique QR code**.
3. The QR code leads to a **digitally stored version** of the receipt.
4. The business owner can scan or open the link any time â€“ no more lost receipts.
5. All expenses are stored in a searchable system with **detailed reports**.
